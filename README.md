### The applicationâ€™s development and implementation:  

**Business context:**  
Have you ever had a hard time converting celsius to fahrenheit or vice versa? IF yes, then this project is for you!  
    
- The application can convert temperatures from celsius to fahrenheit and back.  

We have made the frontend/client application in angular and the rest service in java with springboot. 
The rest service is making the temperature convertion by asking an open SOAP service from w3
