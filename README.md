### The applicationâ€™s development and implementation:  

**Business context:**  
Have you ever had a hard time converting celsius to fahrenheit or vice versa? If yes, then this project is for you!  
    
- The application can convert temperatures from celsius to fahrenheit and back.  

We have made the frontend/client application in angular and the rest service in java with springboot.  
The rest service is making the temperature convertion by asking an open SOAP service from w3  
SOAP implementation is made with java.net library
